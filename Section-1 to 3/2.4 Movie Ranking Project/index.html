<h1>The Best Movies According to Kerem</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>My favorite movie of all-time is The Dark Knight. I love this movie because it is a superhero movie that is not a superhero movie. It is a crime drama that happens to have a superhero in it. The Joker is the best villain of all-time and Heath Ledger's performance is the best acting performance of all-time. The movie is a masterpiece and I love it.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I am a huge Batman fan as you can see. Nothing to say more.</p>
<h4>Joker</h4>
<p>Life of a Joker character</p>
